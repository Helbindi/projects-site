    desc: "The Sacramento State Senior Project was a two semester long process to create a software solution for our client, consisting of a team of eight CS major students.The first semester started with learning and understanding the clients business needs through bi-weekly meetings between the client and the development team. After learning these specifications, the remainder of the semester focused on prototyping designs for the software and fine-tuning our understanding of the clients needs and descs. The second semester was the software production phase utilizing AGILE and SCRUM methodology alongside the information we gained from the previous semester. We built a desktop application using Java, JavaFX, and JDBC for the front and back-end. This desktop application would display stock market information from a REST API endpoint and allow the user to track their intended stocks using CRUD format. This application would also apply our client’s personal criteria for determining when to buy and sell a certain stock.",

    desc: "During the summer of 2019, my Data Structure and Algorithms professor Anna Baynes gave fellow students and I the opportunity to participate in an annual data visualization and analytics competition under her supervision and mentorship. We took on one of the mini challenges regarding earthquake data for a fictional city. This data would consist of earthquake sensor heatmap, information about the city, and self-reported data from citizens. Self-reported data from the citizens consist of when they felt the earthquake, how strong they perceived it, and reported damages. My role on the project was to determine any uncertainty in the data based on the information provided. This project was a six week process with weekly meetings on-campus about what we learned and discovered regarding the data. By the end of the project, we compiled our findings and responses to the analysis questions into a paper that we submitted to the competition.",

I thought that it was pretty cool that you could make a game using JavaScript and decided to try it myself. I replaced the video’s sprites with sprites from one of my favorite GBA games, Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones, that I pieced together using in-game still images to be usable for this project. This project taught me how to render images and animations in Canvas, as well as JavaScript classes to create Objects and update these Objects every frame of animation.",

    desc: "After working on the fighting game, I wanted to try something different with Canvas and decided to make another Fire Emblem inspired game but the gameplay would be based on a mobile game I played called Arknights. This time instead of just two character Objects on the screen, this project would have multiple character Objects on the screen at the same time. The player is able to pick and choose which character they want to place into the game through a UI selector to fight waves of enemy units. This project further taught me how to manage multiple Objects and how to determine when and where they are supposed to interact and affect each other in my code.",

    desc: "In 2022 a new MMO came out called Lost Ark that I started playing with my friend and his guild. In this game there was a separate currency (blue crystals - could be purchased with gold or real money) apart from in-game gold that could be used to buy items. My friend created a google spreadsheet for the guild to determine whether directly spending gold to buy items or using gold to buy blue crystals to buy items was more cost effective. I thought that rather than read and modify a spreadsheet, I would make a website that does the same thing. At the time I read about Svelte, so I decided to try learning and using it to make this website and have Firebase as the backend to keep track of item and blue crystal prices. The website would accept user input about current prices and determine which method was more cost effective. It would also keep record of all user inputs into the database to track changes in price over time. ",
